# Dropbox-Upload-Example
The easy way to upload file into Dropbox. Dropbox can be used as image storage/cdn with low cost budget.

# Config
Don't forget to get your ```ACCESS TOKEN``` here: [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) and change the ```ACCESS_TOKEN``` at ```Dropbox``` class with yours. 
In this example, the file which uploaded will be also shared, so everyone can access the file and we can put the image/photo into ImageView.
